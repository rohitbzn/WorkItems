# SOLUTION.md

## Solution Design Overview

This solution implements a layered Windows ecosystem for managing "Work Items" with a focus on maintainability, testability, and clear separation of concerns. The architecture is inspired by real-world enterprise patterns and is designed to be extensible and robust for both service and client components.

---

## Layering and Project Structure

The solution is split into three main projects:

- **WorkItems.Shared** (`.NET Standard 2.0`):  
  Contains DTOs, enums, and cross-cutting types. This ensures both the service and client share the same data contracts and constants, reducing duplication and versioning issues.

- **WorkItems.Service** (`.NET 8`):  
  Implements a self-hosted OWIN Web API using Entity Framework 6 for persistence and Serilog for structured logging. The service is organized into the following layers:
    - **Data**: EF6 entities and `DbContext`.
    - **Service**: Web API controllers.
    - **Utilities**: Middleware (API key, correlation ID), background worker, and helpers.
    - **Logic/Application**: (Expandable) for business logic and orchestration, currently minimal due to the simple domain.

- **WorkItems.Client** (`.NET 8, WinForms`):  
  A Windows Forms client that consumes the API using async `HttpClient` calls, displays work items in a `DataGridView`, and allows creation and status updates. Uses Serilog for logging and reads configuration from `appsettings.json`.

## Key Design Decisions

- **.NET Standard for Shared Types**:  
  Chosen for maximum compatibility between .NET Framework and .NET 8 projects.

- **OWIN Self-Hosting**:  
  Enables running the service as a console app or Windows Service, and allows for custom middleware (API key, correlation ID) in a lightweight, testable manner.

- **Entity Framework 6 (not Core)**:  
  Required for compatibility with OWIN and .NET Framework-style hosting, and to demonstrate code-based migrations and async data access.

- **Serilog for Logging**:  
  Provides structured, rolling file logs in both service and client, with correlation ID enrichment for traceability.

- **Layered Architecture**:  
  Promotes separation of concerns, making the solution easier to maintain and extend. Each layer has a clear responsibility.

- **DTO Mapping**:  
  All API contracts use DTOs from the shared library, with explicit mapping between EF entities and DTOs to decouple persistence from transport.

- **Configuration via Files**:  
  Service uses `App.config` for connection strings; client uses `appsettings.json` for API base URL, API key, and logging settings. This allows for easy environment-specific overrides.

- **Background Task**:  
  Implemented with `System.Threading.Timer` to periodically update stale work items, demonstrating safe background processing and logging.

- **API Key and Correlation ID Middleware**:  
  Custom OWIN middleware enforces API key authentication and propagates correlation IDs for end-to-end request tracing.

## Trade-offs and Considerations

- **EF6 vs. EF Core**:  
  EF6 was chosen for compatibility with OWIN and legacy patterns, but lacks some features and performance improvements of EF Core.

- **OWIN vs. ASP.NET Core**:  
  OWIN is less modern than ASP.NET Core, but was selected to match the requirement for a .NET Framework-style, self-hosted service.

- **WinForms for Client**:  
  Chosen for simplicity and compatibility with .NET 8. For more modern UI, WPF or MAUI could be considered.

- **Manual DTO Mapping**:  
  Mapping between entities and DTOs is explicit for clarity and control, but could be automated with tools like AutoMapper in larger projects.

- **Simple API Key Auth**:  
  API key authentication is straightforward but not as secure as OAuth or JWT. Suitable for internal or demo scenarios.

- **Smoke Test Script**:  
  Uses PowerShell for cross-environment automation, but assumes the service can be run as a console app and that port 8085 is available.

---

## Extensibility

- **Business Logic Layer**:  
  The `Logic` and `Application` folders are ready for expansion as business rules grow.

- **Additional Endpoints**:  
  The API can be extended with more controllers or actions as needed.

- **Authentication**:  
  The API key middleware can be replaced or augmented with more robust authentication as requirements evolve.

- **UI Enhancements**:  
  The client can be extended with dialogs for item creation, status selection, and richer error handling.

## Summary

This solution demonstrates a maintainable, layered approach to building a Windows ecosystem with modern .NET technologies, clear separation of concerns, and robust logging and configuration. The design choices balance compatibility, simplicity, and extensibility, making it a solid foundation for further development.
